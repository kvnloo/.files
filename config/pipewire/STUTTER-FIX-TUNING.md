# Sample Rate Switching Stutter Fix - Tuning Guide

## Current Configuration (Applied)

```lua
["api.alsa.start-delay"] = 12288,    -- ~256ms @ 48kHz, ~278ms @ 44.1kHz (Option 1)
["api.alsa.period-size"] = 1024,     -- Larger buffer chunks
["api.alsa.headroom"] = 4096,        -- Extra safety margin
["session.suspend-timeout-seconds"] = 0,  -- Never suspend DX5
```

## Why the Delay is Adaptive (Automatically!)

The `start-delay` is measured in **samples**, not milliseconds. This means it automatically scales with sample rate:

| Sample Rate | Delay (samples) | Time (ms) | Use Case |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| 44.1 kHz | 12288 | **278ms** | Spotify, CD-quality FLAC |
| 48 kHz | 12288 | **256ms** | YouTube, video audio |
| 88.2 kHz | 12288 | **139ms** | Hi-res music (CD family) |
| 96 kHz | 12288 | **128ms** | Hi-res music (DVD family) |
| 176.4 kHz | 12288 | **70ms** | Ultra hi-res (CD family) |
| 192 kHz | 12288 | **64ms** | Ultra hi-res (DVD family) |
| 384 kHz | 12288 | **32ms** | Extreme hi-res |
| 768 kHz | 12288 | **16ms** | Maximum DX5 capability |

**Key insight:** Higher sample rates get proportionally shorter delays because the DAC clock locks faster at higher frequencies!

## Understanding the Stutter

### What Happens During Sample Rate Switch

```
Song A @ 44.1kHz playing
    ‚Üì
Song B @ 48kHz starts
    ‚Üì
[CRITICAL TRANSITION PERIOD]
1. PipeWire tells DAC: "Switch to 48kHz"
2. DAC stops 44.1kHz clock
3. DAC initializes 48kHz clock PLL
4. PLL locks to new frequency (takes time!)
5. DAC ready for 48kHz audio
    ‚Üì
If audio starts during step 3-4: STUTTER/CLICK ‚ùå
If audio starts after step 5: SMOOTH ‚úÖ
```

### The start-delay Solution

```
Before fix:
PipeWire ‚Üí "Switch to 48kHz" ‚Üí Audio immediately ‚Üí CLICK! ‚ùå

After fix:
PipeWire ‚Üí "Switch to 48kHz" ‚Üí 12288 samples silence ‚Üí Audio starts ‚Üí Smooth! ‚úÖ
                                 ‚Üë
                         DAC locks during this silence
```

## If Stutter Still Occurs

### Option 1: Increase Delay (Conservative)

Edit `51-topping-dx5-bitperfect.lua`:

```lua
["api.alsa.start-delay"] = 12288,  -- 50% more time
```

**Timing:**
- @ 44.1kHz: 278ms
- @ 48kHz: 256ms
- @ 96kHz: 128ms

### Option 2: Even More Aggressive

```lua
["api.alsa.start-delay"] = 16384,  -- Double current value
["api.alsa.period-size"] = 2048,   -- Even larger buffers
["api.alsa.headroom"] = 8192,      -- More safety margin
```

**Timing:**
- @ 44.1kHz: 371ms
- @ 48kHz: 341ms
- @ 96kHz: 171ms

**Trade-off:** More latency when starting playback, but guaranteed smooth transitions.

### Option 3: Ultra-Conservative (Nuclear Option)

```lua
["api.alsa.start-delay"] = 24576,  -- 3x current value
["api.alsa.period-size"] = 4096,
["api.alsa.headroom"] = 16384,
```

**Timing:**
- @ 44.1kHz: 557ms
- @ 48kHz: 512ms
- @ 96kHz: 256ms

**When to use:** Only if Options 1-2 still stutter. This is half a second of delay!

## Why You Might Still Hear Stutter

### 1. DAC Needs More Lock Time
**Solution:** Increase `start-delay` (see options above)

### 2. Device Suspend/Resume
**Solution:** Already fixed with `session.suspend-timeout-seconds = 0`

### 3. High Tide Gapless Playback Issues
**Problem:** High Tide might have bugs with gapless + PipeWire
**Solution:** Disable gapless in High Tide settings (if option exists)

### 4. First Sound Cut Off
**Problem:** The delay only applies to **new streams**, not the first sample of audio
**Explanation:** This is normal - the delay buffers silence BEFORE audio. Once audio starts, it plays normally. You shouldn't lose any samples.

### 5. USB Bus Issues
**Problem:** USB controller interference
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check for USB errors
dmesg | grep -i "usb.*audio\|alsa.*error" | tail -20

# Try different USB port (preferably USB 2.0, not 3.0)
# Some DACs have issues with USB 3.0 power management
```

## Testing the Fix

### Best Test Method

1. **Open Two Sources at Different Rates:**
   - Tab 1: Spotify (44.1kHz)
   - Tab 2: YouTube (48kHz)

2. **Switch Quickly Between Them:**
   - Play Spotify for 5 seconds
   - Switch to YouTube
   - **Listen during transition** - should be smooth now!

3. **Monitor in Real-Time:**
   ```bash
   watch -n 0.5 'cat /proc/asound/card0/stream0 | grep "Momentary freq"'
   ```
   You'll see: `44099 Hz` ‚Üí `48000 Hz`

### What "Fixed" Sounds Like

**Before:**
```
Song @ 44.1kHz ‚Üí click/pop/stutter ‚Üí Song @ 48kHz
```

**After:**
```
Song @ 44.1kHz ‚Üí brief silence (~170ms) ‚Üí Song @ 48kHz
                      ‚Üë
                No clicks or pops!
```

## Understanding the Trade-off

| Delay (samples) | @ 44.1kHz | @ 48kHz | Smoothness | Perceived Latency |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **4096** (original) | 93ms | 85ms | Moderate | Barely noticeable |
| **8192** | 186ms | 171ms | Better | Still acceptable |
| **12288** (current) | 278ms | 256ms | Very good | Noticeable but okay |
| **16384** | 371ms | 341ms | Excellent | Noticeable delay |
| **24576** | 557ms | 512ms | Perfect | Half-second pause |

**Sweet spot for most users:** 12288-16384 samples

## Why This Approach is Correct

### Alternative Approaches (That Don't Work)

‚ùå **Force fixed sample rate:**
- Requires resampling everything ‚Üí not bit-perfect
- Wastes CPU
- Defeats the purpose of automatic rate switching

‚ùå **ALSA-level hacks with .asoundrc:**
- Breaks PipeWire integration
- Loses multi-app support
- Complex and fragile

‚ùå **Wait for High Tide to add prebuffer option:**
- Doesn't address the root cause (DAC locking time)
- Would only help if High Tide was the problem

‚úÖ **PipeWire start-delay (Our Approach):**
- Works at the right layer (between PipeWire and ALSA)
- Maintains bit-perfect playback
- Preserves multi-app support
- Adaptive to sample rate automatically
- Clean, maintainable solution

## Verifying Current Settings

Check if settings are applied:

```bash
# Method 1: Check node properties (if available)
pw-cli info $(pactl list sinks short | grep DX5 | awk '{print $1}')

# Method 2: Monitor buffer behavior during playback
pw-top
# Look at QUANT (quantum) and RATE columns

# Method 3: Check ALSA directly
cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/sub0/hw_params
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current fix** (12288 samples)
2. **If still stuttering:** Try Option 2 (16384 samples)
3. **If Option 2 insufficient:** Try Option 3 (24576 samples)
4. **Report back:** What delay value worked for you?

---

## Fine-Tuning by Sample Rate

If certain sample rates still stutter, you can't configure per-rate delays in PipeWire directly. However, you can:

1. **Increase global delay** until all rates are smooth
2. **Accept longer delay at lower rates** (adaptive scaling means high rates still fast)
3. **Use ALSA exclusive mode** for problematic tracks (nuclear option)

## The Physics of DAC Locking

**Why does this take time?**

USB DACs use a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to generate the audio clock:
1. **Receive sample rate command** from USB (~instant)
2. **VCO starts at new frequency** (~1ms)
3. **PLL phase detector** compares to USB SOF timing
4. **PLL converges** to lock (10-200ms depending on PLL design)
5. **Jitter settles** to spec (~50ms additional)

**Total: 60-250ms** for typical USB DACs

The Topping DX5 is a high-quality DAC, but USB audio class compliance means it follows standard USB Audio timing, which is why we need the prebuffer.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Current config**: 12288 samples (~256-278ms)
‚úÖ **Should eliminate most stuttering**
‚úÖ **Automatically adaptive** to sample rate
‚úÖ **Preserves bit-perfect playback**

If still stuttering: Increase `start-delay` to 16384 or 24576 samples.

**Test it now!** Switch between Spotify and YouTube rapidly - should be smooth! üéß
