High-Fidelity Audio Optimization on Ubuntu 24.04: A Guide to PipeWire, AutoEQ, and Reference-Grade Playback




I. Executive Summary: Three Critical Paths to Optimal Audio


Achieving the highest possible audio fidelity for the specified system—comprising an Intel 10900k, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti, Sennheiser HD 800 S, Topping DX5 DAC, and Topping A90 amplifier running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (PipeWire)—requires a multi-layered approach focusing on digital signal transport integrity, precise equalization, and appropriate source application selection.
The analysis confirms three primary critical paths must be optimized:
1. Signal Processing Priority (Convolution Confirmed): Digital signal processing (DSP) theory confirms that the Convolution Filter, implemented via Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters, is the optimal and most precise method for static headphone equalization, such as that provided by AutoEQ. FIR filters maintain linear phase coherence, which is theoretically superior to the non-linear phase response inherent in Parametric Equalization (PEQ) using Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters.1
2. Transport Layer Optimization (PipeWire): The core audio server, PipeWire, must be configured to maximize dynamic sample rate switching. This is essential to ensure the digital audio stream delivered to the high-performance Topping DX5 DAC matches the source file's native sample rate, thus avoiding unnecessary software resampling (a technique sometimes referred to as achieving a "bit-perfect" stream).3
3. Immediate Troubleshooting Solution (Stereo Impulse): The observation that the EasyEffects convolution filter produces "no difference" in sound is highly likely due to a technical incompatibility: EasyEffects' Convolver plugin typically requires a stereo impulse response file, whereas AutoEQ commonly generates the necessary minimum phase equalization file in mono format.5 A simple command-line conversion is required to resolve this configuration failure.


II. The Foundational Layer: Configuring PipeWire for Reference Audio Transport


The operating system's audio architecture serves as the foundation for high-fidelity playback. Ubuntu 24.04 utilizes the modern PipeWire sound server, replacing older architectures like PulseAudio and JACK.7 Given the power of the Intel 10900k processor, PipeWire offers the flexibility and low latency capabilities necessary for demanding DSP operations.


2.1. Validating the PipeWire Core on Ubuntu 24.04


Recent distributions transitioning to PipeWire sometimes retain residual configurations or packages from the older PulseAudio/ALSA stack, leading to instability.7 The first crucial step is confirming that PipeWire is running as the sole audio server. This can be verified via the command line by checking the reported server name, which should indicate PipeWire is active.8 Ensuring all necessary components, including the WirePlumber session manager, are running robustly is a prerequisite for stable operation, particularly when dealing with long impulse responses and high sample rates.


2.2. Optimizing the Topping DX5 DAC Interface (The Bit-Perfect Goal)


The Topping DX5 is an advanced USB DAC supporting high-resolution audio up to 24-bit/192 kHz and full MQA decoding.9 To maximize the performance of this external hardware, the audio pipeline must strive to deliver the source audio to the DAC at its native resolution, bypassing the internal software mixer whenever possible.
This optimization is achieved by modifying PipeWire's configuration parameters, which are typically customized via configuration overlays in the user's home directory (~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/).11


Dynamic Sample Rate Matching


The most critical modification involves setting the allowed clock rates. PipeWire will attempt to match the stream rate of the active audio application to one of the defined default.clock.allowed-rates. By listing standard sample rates and their multiples up to the DX5’s maximum of 192 kHz, the system ensures that high-resolution content (such as 88.2 kHz or 96 kHz streams from Tidal) is delivered without requiring PipeWire to resample the data stream.3
A recommended configuration for high-fidelity use includes the standard rates derived from the two main frequency families (44.1 kHz and 48 kHz):
default.clock.allowed-rates = [ 44100 48000 88200 96000 176400 192000 ]
Although some DACs report higher theoretical limits, configuring PipeWire to rates reliably achievable by the DX5’s USB input (up to 192 kHz) prevents potential instability and audio breakage that can occur when pushing non-standard or unsupported rates.10


Maximizing Resampling Quality


In scenarios where resampling is necessary—such as when multiple audio sources are mixed, or when source content does not match the allowed rates—the quality of PipeWire’s internal resampler should be maximized. The default setting of resample.quality = 4 is selected for its balance of performance and audio quality.12
However, given the extremely capable Intel 10900k processor, the system is ideally positioned to handle the maximum computational load for superior quality. The highest setting, resample.quality = 14, significantly increases the computational load (potentially 2–3 times higher than lower settings) but minimizes aliasing and filter artifacts during the resampling process.10 While the audible difference between quality levels 10 and 14 may be minimal, the powerful CPU ensures this resource-intensive setting can be implemented without risk of audio dropouts or performance degradation. This shifts the configuration philosophy from efficiency to absolute fidelity.


2.3. Advanced System Tuning for Stability and Latency


To ensure the high DSP demands of convolution filtering are met stably, advanced system tuning is advised. Convolution filters inherently introduce latency and require predictable system behavior.1
1. Real-Time Priorities (RLIMITs): Configuring limits for the PipeWire user group (often requiring membership in the pipewire group) and setting memory locking limits (memlock) ensures the audio processing threads maintain system priority, preventing interruptions during demanding DSP phases.13
2. CPU Governor: The default CPU frequency scaling governor, often set to powersave, allows the CPU to throttle speed dynamically. For critical, low-latency audio processing, setting the governor to performance guarantees sustained clock speeds, providing the most stable and predictable processing environment for the convolution filter.13
The combined configuration changes for the PipeWire foundation are summarized below.

III. Maximizing Source Fidelity: Tidal Hi-Res on Linux


The quality of the final audio output is critically dependent on the streaming client's ability to access Tidal’s highest resolution streams. Tidal offers Max quality streams up to 24-bit, 192 kHz (including Hi-Res FLAC and MQA).15


3.1. Client Comparison for Max Quality Streaming


Using the Tidal web player is insufficient for high-fidelity audio, as it is strictly limited to standard Hi-Fi quality (up to 320 kbps) and cannot access Hi-Res FLAC or MQA streams.15 To access the Max quality tier, a dedicated application that replicates the official desktop experience is required.
* Unofficial Electron App (Tidal Hi-Fi): This application utilizes the web player wrapped in Electron.17 While often supporting Widevine DRM necessary for higher streams 17, it may not fully support advanced features like Exclusive Mode or guarantee MQA bitstream integrity, making it a potentially suboptimal choice for reference-grade output.
* Dedicated Player (Strawberry): Strawberry Music Player, a fork of Clementine, is frequently used by audiophiles on Linux and integrates well with PipeWire for native sample rate output.4 Although it requires non-official API tokens for Tidal access, it represents a robust player optimized for audio fidelity.18
* Roon/Dedicated Server: For the ultimate in quality, library management, and integration, software like Roon (which supports the Topping DX5 as a Roon endpoint) offers a highly optimized path.19 Dedicated Linux audiophile server distributions, such as MusicLounge, are also available, specifically designed to handle high-resolution formats like MQA, PCM, and DSD through USB DACs using the Music Player Daemon (MPD).20


3.2. The Exclusive Mode Conflict and MQA Trade-Off


The official Tidal desktop application on Windows and Mac utilizes "Exclusive Mode" (e.g., WASAPI Exclusive, ASIO) to gain sole control of the audio device, ensuring the digital stream reaches the DAC untouched and bit-perfect.21 This bit-perfect transmission is mandatory for the Topping DX5 to correctly detect and perform MQA full decoding (rendering).9
On Linux, PipeWire can approximate this functionality (e.g., using the "Pro Audio" profile 22), but the key conflict arises when the user introduces the AutoEQ correction via EasyEffects.
Any digital signal processing (DSP), including equalization, fundamentally modifies the incoming bitstream before it reaches the DAC. This modification inherently destroys the integrity of the MQA stream, preventing the Topping DX5 from performing MQA full decoding.
Therefore, the user faces an unavoidable trade-off: prioritize Corrected Sound (AutoEQ) or prioritize Untouched MQA Passthrough. Given the Sennheiser HD 800 S typically benefits significantly from equalization to conform to a neutral target, the analysis recommends prioritizing the AutoEQ correction. MQA streams will still play at high quality (often treated as standard Hi-Res FLAC) but will not receive the final MQA rendering benefits.


IV. Digital Signal Processing: FIR Convolution vs. IIR Parametric EQ


The user’s initial assessment regarding the superiority of the convolution filter is substantiated by underlying DSP principles, particularly concerning phase coherence. Headphone equalization, as implemented by AutoEQ, is designed to precisely correct the headphone's measured frequency response against a target curve (e.g., the Harman target curve).23


4.1. IIR (Parametric EQ) Analysis


Parametric Equalization (PEQ) is typically implemented using Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. IIR filters are computationally very efficient and introduce extremely low latency, making them highly desirable for general use or live audio.2 AutoEQ demonstrates that 10 PEQ filters are often sufficient to correct most headphones.24
The primary technical limitation of IIR filters is that they introduce non-linear phase shifts (phase rotation) as frequency changes.2 While many audiophiles consider these shifts inaudible, maintaining phase coherence is a key goal in high-end audio playback, particularly for open-back dynamic headphones like the HD 800 S, where accurate transient response and soundstage are critical.


4.2. FIR (Convolution Filter) Analysis


Convolution filters use Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. Unlike IIR filters, FIR filters are non-recursive, meaning their output is calculated only based on the current and past input values, without using feedback.2 This property allows FIR filters to implement perfect linear phase filtering.1
Linear phase ensures that all frequencies across the spectrum are delayed by the exact same amount. This maintains the temporal relationship (transient response) between different frequency components, which is critical for preserving the subtle details and perceived accuracy of the audio waveform. FIR filters are extremely flexible and can model virtually any desired frequency response curve with high precision, making them ideal for applying the complex, calculated corrections provided by AutoEQ.24
The trade-offs for FIR filters are significant: they require substantially more computational power and inherently introduce longer latency compared to IIR filters.1 However, as established in Section 2, the powerful 10900k CPU is capable of handling this elevated DSP requirement without stability issues, thereby validating the choice of convolution for maximum theoretical fidelity.

V. Practical Implementation: EasyEffects and AutoEQ Troubleshooting


EasyEffects serves as the most accessible graphical front-end for applying system-wide PipeWire effects, acting as the successor to PulseEffects.7 When configuring effects, it is generally recommended to use the Flatpak version of EasyEffects for maximum stability and compatibility.8


5.1. EasyEffects Setup and Signal Flow


Once EasyEffects is running and connected to the PipeWire server, the Convolver plugin must be activated within the Output tab and placed in the signal chain.8 The user must confirm the target sample rate of the system (or the rate PipeWire is currently using) to ensure the correct impulse response file is downloaded from the AutoEQ repository (e.g., the 48000 Hz variant).8


5.2. Resolving the "No Difference" Issue (Mono/Stereo Mismatch)


The user's experience that the convolution filter did not audibly change the sound points to a fundamental configuration failure related to channel mapping, a common issue documented in EasyEffects environments.
The analysis indicates that AutoEQ's minimum phase correction files are often generated as single-channel (mono) WAV impulse files.6 However, the EasyEffects Convolver plugin (based on the zita convolver library) is primarily designed to accept and process stereo impulse files.5 When a mono file is loaded, the application may fail to process the effect, often with little or no error feedback in the GUI, resulting in the observed lack of audible change.5


Required Fix: Mono-to-Stereo Duplication


To resolve this, the mono impulse file must be converted into a two-channel (stereo) WAV file by duplicating the single channel's data into both the Left and Right channels. This is not a psychoacoustic process like stereo widening, but a strict duplication required for EasyEffects compatibility.6 The integrity of the equalization curve remains unaffected because the convolution is applied identically to both headphone channels.
The channel duplication can be executed using command-line audio manipulation tools such as FFmpeg or SoX.
FFmpeg Command for Stereo Conversion:
Assuming the AutoEQ file is 32-bit (common for FIR files 27), the following command uses FFmpeg to duplicate the mono channel and save it as a new stereo file, ensuring the bit depth is preserved:
ffmpeg -i input\_mono\_48000Hz.wav -c:a pcm\_s32le -ac 2 output\_stereo\_48000Hz.wav
Once the corrected stereo WAV file is created, it should be imported successfully via the EasyEffects GUI under the Convolver plugin's Impulses menu.8


5.3. Verification


After loading the stereo impulse file, the user should visually confirm the effect is active. The Convolver plugin in EasyEffects provides a Spectrum visualization that will display the inverted frequency response curve (the EQ profile) being applied. This visual check confirms the DSP is engaged and correctly routing audio through the convolution filter.28 It is also important to ensure that the convolver is not applying unintentional effects such as stereo widening.8


VI. Advanced Alternative: System-Wide PipeWire Filter-Chain Integration


While EasyEffects provides an excellent, user-friendly interface for system-wide DSP, highly advanced users seeking the absolute lowest system overhead may consider migrating the convolution process directly into the PipeWire core daemon.
The PipeWire module libpipewire-module-filter-chain enables the creation of arbitrary audio processing graphs using LADSPA, LV2, and built-in filters.30 By configuring the equalization within the PipeWire kernel, the process bypasses the EasyEffects application layer, potentially reducing overall system resource consumption and eliminating stability issues related to the GUI.8


6.1. Integrating LV2 Convolution


This approach requires using a standalone LV2 convolution plugin (many are available in Linux repositories, such as the Calf or LSP plugin suites).32
The configuration involves creating a dedicated .conf file (e.g., in ~/.config/pipewire/filter-chain.conf.d/) that defines a virtual output sink. This sink captures the system audio, routes it through a filter node defined as the LV2 convolution plugin, and then connects the filtered output directly to the Topping DX5 DAC.30 The impulse file path and necessary control parameters are defined within the node's configuration section.
Moving the DSP to the filter-chain provides the most streamlined operational method but requires significant technical expertise for configuration and debugging, aligning with the goal of absolute system optimization for an advanced enthusiast.32


Conclusions and Recommendations


The Sennheiser HD 800 S paired with the Topping DX5/A90 stack represents a high-performance audio setup, which, when properly configured on Ubuntu 24.04 (PipeWire), can deliver reference-grade fidelity superior to most operating system defaults.
The analysis provides a conclusive rationale for the user's focus on convolution: FIR filters are the most accurate DSP technique for static headphone correction, preserving crucial phase linearity and temporal coherence.
Based on the required optimizations, the following actionable steps are presented in order of priority:
1. Immediate Fix for EasyEffects: Convert the mono AutoEQ impulse response file for the HD 800 S into a stereo WAV file using a tool like FFmpeg or SoX. This is the critical step required to make the convolution filter audibly functional in EasyEffects.
2. PipeWire Transport Layer: Implement the recommended configurations in the PipeWire configuration files, specifically setting default.clock.allowed-rates to enable dynamic sample rate switching up to 192 kHz and setting resample.quality = 14. Apply system-level optimizations (Performance Governor and Real-time Limits) commensurate with the 10900k CPU to ensure maximum DSP stability.
3. Tidal Client Selection: Use a dedicated high-fidelity client (such as Strawberry or Roon) over the Electron wrapper to ensure access to Tidal Max quality streams. Accept the necessary trade-off that applying convolution DSP via EasyEffects will modify the digital stream, overriding the conditions required for MQA full decoding by the Topping DX5.
4. Verification: Load the corrected stereo impulse into EasyEffects and visually verify the applied curve using the Spectrum tool to confirm that the high-precision AutoEQ correction is fully engaged across both channels.
