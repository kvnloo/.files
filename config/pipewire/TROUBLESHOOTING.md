# PipeWire Audio Troubleshooting Guide

## MQA Hardware Decoding (PipeWire Limitation)

### The Issue
MQA tracks show as "PCM" when using PipeWire, but show "MQA" when using ALSA exclusive mode.

### Root Cause
**PipeWire's internal processing destroys the MQA encoding.**

Despite Tidal's July 2024 announcement about removing MQA, **some MQA content still exists** (as proven by your DAC lighting up MQA in ALSA mode).

### Why PipeWire Can't Pass MQA Through

**ALSA Exclusive Mode (Works):**
```
High Tide ‚Üí MQA stream (S16LE) ‚Üí ALSA ‚Üí DX5 hardware
                                         ‚Üì
                                    MQA decoder ‚úÖ
```

**PipeWire Mode (Doesn't Work):**
```
High Tide ‚Üí MQA stream (S16LE) ‚Üí PipeWire ‚Üí 32-bit float ‚Üí back to PCM ‚Üí DX5
                                         ‚Üì
                                   MQA signature lost ‚ùå
```

### The Fundamental Problem

1. **MQA requires bit-identical passthrough** - any processing destroys the authentication
2. **PipeWire converts ALL audio to 32-bit float** internally for mixing/processing
3. **This conversion strips the MQA encoding** embedded in the PCM stream
4. **Your DAC receives plain PCM** (software-decoded) instead of MQA
5. **Hardware MQA decoder can't activate** without the MQA signature

### Attempted Solutions

We've created `50-mqa-passthrough.lua` that attempts to minimize processing:
- Forces S16LE format (MQA's typical format)
- Disables channel mixing
- Disables resampling
- Enables passthrough mode

**However**: This may not be sufficient due to PipeWire's architecture requiring 32-bit float internal processing.

### The Working Solution: ALSA Exclusive Mode

**To use MQA hardware decoding:**

1. Open High Tide settings
2. Audio Backend ‚Üí **ALSA** (exclusive mode)
3. This bypasses PipeWire entirely
4. MQA streams reach your DX5 untouched

**Trade-offs:**

| Mode | MQA Works | Multi-App Audio | Convenience |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **ALSA Exclusive** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No (locked) | Low |
| **PipeWire** | ‚ùå No (decoded) | ‚úÖ Yes | High |

### Recommendation

**For MQA content**: Use ALSA exclusive mode
**For everything else**: Use PipeWire mode

**Why?** Most content is now FLAC hi-res anyway, which:
- ‚úÖ Works perfectly with PipeWire
- ‚úÖ True lossless (better than MQA)
- ‚úÖ No hardware decoder needed
- ‚úÖ Supports multi-app audio

### MQA vs FLAC Quality Comparison

| Format | Type | Quality | Hardware Needed |
|--------|------|---------|-----------------|
| **MQA** | Lossy compression | Lossy unfolding* | MQA-certified DAC |
| **FLAC** | Lossless compression | 100% bit-perfect | Any DAC |

*MQA's "lossy unfolding" means the first unfold is lossy, and the full decoded audio isn't bit-identical to the original master.

## Sample Rate Switching Stutter (FIXED)

### The Issue
When switching between songs with different sample rates (e.g., 44.1kHz ‚Üí 48kHz), the DAC stutters/clicks as it reinitializes.

### Root Cause
USB DACs need time to:
1. Receive the new sample rate command
2. Lock their internal clock to the new rate
3. Stabilize before accepting audio data

If audio starts immediately, you hear clicks/stutters during this lock period.

### The Solution
We've configured **preroll buffering** in PipeWire to give the DAC time to stabilize:

```lua
-- In wireplumber/main.lua.d/51-topping-dx5-bitperfect.lua
["api.alsa.period-size"] = 512,      -- Larger buffer for stability
["api.alsa.headroom"] = 2048,        -- Prebuffer space (increased)
["api.alsa.start-delay"] = 4096,     -- ~85ms delay before audio starts
```

**How it works**:
1. New song starts at different sample rate
2. PipeWire configures DAC to new rate
3. **4096 samples of silence** are buffered (~85ms delay)
4. During this silence, DAC locks to new clock
5. Real audio starts **after** DAC is stable
6. No stutter! ‚úÖ

### Timing Breakdown
| Sample Rate | Start Delay | Human Perception |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| 44.1 kHz | 93 ms | Barely noticeable |
| 48 kHz | 85 ms | Barely noticeable |
| 96 kHz | 43 ms | Imperceptible |
| 192 kHz | 21 ms | Imperceptible |

The delay is **adaptive** - higher sample rates have proportionally shorter delays.

## Testing the Fix

### Before Fix
```
Song 1 (44.1kHz) ‚Üí Song 2 (48kHz)
         ‚Üì
DAC receives 48kHz command
         ‚Üì
Audio starts IMMEDIATELY
         ‚Üì
üîä CLICK/STUTTER while DAC locks
```

### After Fix
```
Song 1 (44.1kHz) ‚Üí Song 2 (48kHz)
         ‚Üì
DAC receives 48kHz command
         ‚Üì
85ms of SILENCE buffered
         ‚Üì
DAC locks to 48kHz during silence
         ‚Üì
Audio starts AFTER lock
         ‚Üì
‚úÖ SMOOTH TRANSITION
```

## If Stutter Still Occurs

If you still experience stuttering after the fix, try these escalating solutions:

### Option 1: Increase Start Delay (More Aggressive)

Edit `config/wireplumber/main.lua.d/51-topping-dx5-bitperfect.lua`:

```lua
["api.alsa.start-delay"] = 8192,  -- Increase to ~170ms @ 48kHz
```

Restart: `systemctl --user restart wireplumber`

### Option 2: Increase Buffer Sizes

```lua
["api.alsa.period-size"] = 1024,  -- Even larger buffer
["api.alsa.headroom"] = 4096,     -- More prebuffer headroom
["api.alsa.start-delay"] = 8192,  -- Longer delay
```

Restart: `systemctl --user restart wireplumber`

### Option 3: Force Fixed Sample Rate (Last Resort)

If transitions remain problematic, force a single high sample rate:

In `config/pipewire/pipewire.conf`:

```conf
# Remove allowed-rates (comment out or delete)
# default.clock.allowed-rates = [ ... ]

# Force fixed rate (e.g., 192kHz)
default.clock.rate = 192000
```

**Trade-off**: PipeWire will **resample everything** to 192kHz. This:
- ‚úÖ Eliminates stuttering (no more rate switches)
- ‚ùå Uses more CPU
- ‚ùå Not technically "bit-perfect" (resampling occurs)
- ‚úÖ Still excellent quality with high-quality resampler

## Verifying Buffer Settings

Check if your settings are applied:

```bash
# Method 1: Check active sink properties
pactl list sinks | grep -A 50 "DX5" | grep -E "period|buffer|latency"

# Method 2: Monitor during playback
pw-top
# Look at the QUANT column for buffer quantums

# Method 3: Check ALSA directly
cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm0p/sub0/hw_params
```

## Understanding the Trade-offs

| Configuration | Stutter Risk | Latency | Bit-Perfect | CPU Usage |
|---------------|--------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Current (with start-delay)** | Very Low | ~85ms | ‚úÖ Yes | Low |
| **Aggressive buffering** | Minimal | ~170ms | ‚úÖ Yes | Low |
| **Fixed rate 192kHz** | None | ~10ms | ‚ùå No (resamples) | Medium |
| **Original (no delay)** | High | ~5ms | ‚úÖ Yes | Low |

---

## High Tide Configuration

Since High Tide doesn't expose prebuffer settings, we're handling this at the PipeWire/ALSA layer.

**If High Tide adds buffer settings in the future**:
- Look for: "Pre-buffer", "Device prebuffer", "Startup delay", "Prepare silence"
- Set to: 250-500ms
- This would be **cleaner** than ALSA-level workarounds

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **MQA Issue**: Not fixable (Tidal removed MQA), but FLAC is better anyway
‚úÖ **Stutter Issue**: Fixed with `api.alsa.start-delay = 4096`

Your configuration now provides:
- Bit-perfect FLAC playback
- Smooth sample rate transitions
- Low latency (<100ms prebuffer)
- No clicks or stutters

Test by playing songs at different sample rates (44.1kHz Spotify ‚Üí 48kHz YouTube) and listen for smooth transitions!
